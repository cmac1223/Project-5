# README

Talent Tracker is an app that allows you to track your favorite local artist.  You'll be able to keep up with their latest artwork along with whatever future events they will be participating in.  The languages,  database, tools, and frameworks I used were Angular on Rails,  Postgresql, git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, and Materialize. I attached a Google Map API in order to display the artist's event.  I attached a Google Geolocation API in order to grab the longitude latitude coordinates. My next goal for Talent Tracker is to attach a payment API that will allow supporters to make donations to their favorite local artist.  For example, if the artist is tied to some sort of charity the API can act like a fund me account for the cause. IN ORDER TO VIEW THE GOOGLE MAPS API PLEASE ENABLE CROSS-ORIGIN RESOURCR SHARING (CORS) APP IS STILL IN BETA MODE IT'S ABOUT 80% COMPLETE
